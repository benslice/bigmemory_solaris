# BJV Dec 07, 2012

This repo contains the R package bigmemory 
with 2 hacks to get it to build on solaris.

There are 2 patchfiles in the root which demonstrate
the differences, one to "configure" and the other to "isna.hpp"

These paches have already been applied to the tree. So you
can pull the whole tree and build it, or just grab the
patches and apply them to your bigmemory src (say if you
have a newer version).


Everything below this line is from the original bigmemory README

# These first notes document changes to the BOOST includes required
# for the Bigmemory Project.

1. Removed boost/interprocess/containers/detail since it was empty.
2. os_file_functions.hpp: Changed line 125 from

  if(size > filesize){

  to 

  if(size > static_cast<std::size_t>(filesize)){

  to get rid of the compiler warning.

3. seed_rng.hpp: Changed line 150 from

  std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );
 
  to 

  size_t temp = std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );

# These second notes document a change required to get Sun Studio 12.1
# working with C++.

# See http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5393796,
# the comment by liboqun on Dec 10, 2009.  We followed the
# instructions, replacing the 12.1 version of cdefs.h with
# the recommended version from Sun Studio 12, resolving the
# problem (errors relating to stdio.h).
